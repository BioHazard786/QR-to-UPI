# QR to UPI: A Tale of Distance and Server Failure

Once upon a time, my friends and I were separated by distance (and bad life choices).

Even though we are miles apart, they still have a very specific talent: buying things and then realizing their bank server is down.
"Bro, my bank is down again. Can you pay? I'll GPay you later."

Then comes the dreaded **QR Code Photo**.

Since we aren't together, they take a photo of the shopkeeper's sticky, laminated QR code and WhatsApp it to me.

**The Old Way (The Way of Pain):**
1.  Open WhatsApp.
2.  Download image.
3.  Open UPI App.
4.  Tap "Scan".
5.  Tap "Gallery".
6.  Scroll past 500 screenshots and memes to find the QR code.
7.  Finally pay (hoping *my* bank server isn't also down).

I did this approximately 4,000 times. My thumb started cramping. My gallery was full of random shop QR codes.

**"ENOUGH!" I cried.**

And thus, **QR to UPI** was born.

## The Solution
Now, when my friends send me that inevitable photo from across the city, I simply share it to **QR to UPI**. Boom. Done. No saving, no scrolling, no crying.

## The "Dual UPI Relay" (Because I'm a Benevolent God)
I realized that sometimes, *I* am the problem. Sometimes I need to send a QR code to someone else.

But I refused to perpetuate the cycle of "Save Image -> Scan from Gallery".

So I added the **Dual UPI Relay**.
This app doesn't just read QR codes; it parses the soul out of them (the UPI ID) and lets me share *that* directly. Either as a fresh, crisp UPI ID or a UPI deep link.

Now, nobody has to save photos. We are free.
