Stop the gallery scroll. Start paying instantly.

We've all been there: A friend sends you a QR code photo on WhatsApp. Now you have to download it, open your UPI app, tap "Scan from Gallery," and scroll through 500 screenshots to find that one QR code.

No more.

QR to UPI is a share target that lets you scan QR codes from photos instantly—without saving them to your device or hunting through your gallery.

🚀 THE PROBLEM:
Your friend's bank server is down (again). They send you a photo of the shopkeeper's QR code. You now have to:
1. Download the image
2. Open your UPI app
3. Navigate to "Scan from Gallery"
4. Scroll past memes and screenshots
5. Find the QR code
6. Finally pay

❌ This is ridiculous.

✨ THE SOLUTION:
Just share the QR code photo directly to QR to UPI. It scans instantly. No saving. No scrolling. No pain.

🔄 DUAL UPI RELAY:
But wait, there's more. Sometimes YOU need to send a UPI ID to someone else.

Instead of forcing them through the same "save → scan from gallery" nightmare, QR to UPI extracts the UPI ID from any QR code and lets you share it directly—either as plain text or as a UPI deep link.

Break the cycle. Set them free.
